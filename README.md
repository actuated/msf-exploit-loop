# msf-exploit-loop
Metasploit resource script to read a list of desired RHOST values and run the current exploit module for each.

# Details
This is a Ruby resource script for Metasploit. The usage scenario is that you want to take an exploit module like `ms08_067_netapi` or `ms17_010_eternalblue`, and run it against a prepared list of intended RHOST targets. The script will read each line of the input file as a target, set that as the current RHOST value, run `exploit -j`.

This is meant to be used with reverse shell payloads, such as `windows/meterpreter/reverse_https`

For example:
  1. Create your list of targets as `exploit_loop_input.txt`.
  2. Start Metasploit and load your module, such as `psexec`.
  3. Configure your other parameters, such as your payload and any credentials needed.
  4. Separately, start `multi/handler` to listen for connections back from reverse shell payloads.
  5. From the exploit's Metasploit prompt, run `resource exploit-launch.rc`.
  6. The script will:
     1. Read the first line from `exploit_loop_input.txt`.
     2. Set that as the `RHOST` value.
     3. Run `exploit -j`.
     4. Sleep for 2 seconds before restarting with the next line from `exploit_loop_input.txt`.
